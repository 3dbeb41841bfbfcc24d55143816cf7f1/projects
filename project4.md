# PROJECT 4 - Ruby on Rails with PostgreSQL

## Requirements

In this project you will be **building a full-stack Rails application** using the following best practices:

* Convention over Configuration
* Model-View-Controller (MVC)
* RESTful routing
* A Database Schema

## Work Individually or on a Team

You can either work _individually_ or in teams of up to 3 team members. If you want to work on a team, you get to choose your team!

## Be Creative

We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals!

## Technical Requirements

Your app must:

- **Use Ruby on Rails or Sinatra**
- **Use Active Record**
- **Use PostgreSQL**
- **Have at least 2 models** (more if they make sense) – one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
- **Include sign up/log in functionality**, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
- **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE
- **Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure** and interact with your relationally-stored data
- **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process
- Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS**
- **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public

## Necessary Deliverables

- A **working full-stack application, built by you (or your team)**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
- A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit early, commit often.
- **A `readme.md` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
- **Wireframes of your app**, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
- A link in your readme.md to the publically-accessible **user stories you created**

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Create a Schedule** - time management is essential!
  - Day 1: Concept, User Stories, Wire Frames
  - Day 2: Create project, GitHub, 1 User Story, Heroku
  - Day 3: More User stories, Heroku
  - Day 4: Styling, Bonus stories, Heroku
  - Day 5: README, Final touches, presentations
* **Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
* **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.** Make sure your team project looks like a unified effort.
* **Commit early, commit often.**
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

## Useful Resources
* [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) (for hosting your back-end)
* [Writing Good User Stories](http://www.mariaemerson.com/user-stories/) (for a few user story tips)
* [Presenting Information Architecture](http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/3-information-architecture/4-presenting-information.html) (for more insight into wireframing)

## Challenge Add-Ons

These are for extra credit! Don't forget -- you'll need to have your base app complete before you build any of these in -- so plan for different stages of your project, including one that meets only the core requirements.

* Use an API -- Google Maps, Yelp, etc (remember this is optional!)
* Use a frontend framework such as AngularJS or React -- Rails will act as a JSON API for your frontend code.

## Project Feedback + Evaluation
- **Project Workflow**: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

- **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

- **Creativity**: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

- **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

- **Problem Solving**: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrated that you thought through alternative implementations? (Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've completed the project.)
