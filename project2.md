# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #2: A MEN Stack Web Site

## Overview

Your mission is to create a Web Application using the MEN Stack - MongoDB, Express, and NodeJS. Your app will perform _CRUD_ operations on 2 or more models and follow the RESTful best practices for defining server-side routes. You will also be required to use _Mongoose_ for ODM (Object Document Mapping).

Your app should consist of at least 2 Mongoose models including a _User_ model. These models should be associated, such as "A User has many recipes" or "A User has many posts and each post has many comments".

---

## Technical Requirements

Your project must:

* **Use Mongo & Express** to build an full-stack web application using server-side Javascript
* **Use at least 2 related models**, one of which should be a user
* Follow the **RESTful** best practices - all routes should be defined using an HTTP GET/PUT/POST/DELETE on a URL that represents the resource being accessed
* Include **all major CRUD functions** for at least one of the models
* **Add authentication and authorization** to your web application to restrict access to appropriate users
* **Craft thoughtful user stories together**
* **Manage Source Code** via Git and GitHub
* Layout and style your front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**
* **Deploy your application online** so it's publically accessible

Bonuses:

* Add some **client-side rendering** with Javascript & jQuery (i.e. making AJAX calls to the server)
* Consume a 3rd party API

---

## Necessary Deliverables

* A **working web application**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **Git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with:
    * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    * Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome
    * **Future vision** for the project

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your routes using RESTful best practices**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.**.
* **Commit early, commit often.**
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

## Potential Project Ideas

Build a creative product that you actually think someone will want to use. We won't have time to do tons of customer research, but take some time to brainstorm. If you're struggling for ideas, the ones below could help get you started.

### Bucketli.st
Besides finishing WDI, you surely have one or two things you'd love to do with your life. Let's get 'em on paper! You could integrate with a third-party location-based API to allow users to search for a location or venue to add to their bucket list items.

### Survey App
Imagine sending out a survey to everyone in the class – what should we eat for lunch today? Or 1-5, how well did you understand what we just learned? It would be even more awesome if it were realtime, so you could see answers pouring in as they're submitted.

### Neighborly
Build a website for neighborhoods where users can post questions, items for sale, or voice concerns. Allow other users to reply to posts with comments, thus creating a discussion thread for each topic.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrated that you thought through alternative implementations? _(Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've completed the project.)_

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
